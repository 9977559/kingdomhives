            <h1>About Us</h1>
            
            <p>Kingdom Hives was created early 2016 by a close friend Steven Maclean and myself (Blake Amann) after purchasing our first hives just one year earlier. 
                    We started off literally watching a few youtube videos, leading to buying 2 hives, which in turn grew to a fair few more by the end of the season. We were hooked.
                    <br><br>
                    I think one of the reasons we are so passionate about beekeeping to this day is that there is multiple benefits not just to ourselves, but in many other ways too. 
                    The world needs bees! 
                    <br><br>
                    Most of our fruit vegetables grains cereals you name need pollination of some sort to grow and be fruitful.
                    <br><br>
                    Honey alone is outstanding for you health wise, its the best form of natural sugar you can consume. <br>
                    Proplis which we extract from our hives also literally saves lives, this is the stuff that has high medicinal purposes. 
                    Also found in facial creams, toothpastes etc.<br>
                    It has the potential to bring an income, we are looking forward for the day when we hit 5000 hives and have the blessing of being able to employee and teach some apprentices
                    These are just a few of the reasons why we love beekeeping. <br>
                    We are passionate about his being a Kingdom business (hence the name) and love pouring back into the community in one way or another, this business is going to change multiple lives around us, its so good. 
                    We thank God everyday for getting us to this level and pray for more to come.<br><br>
                    Thanks for your support!</p>
